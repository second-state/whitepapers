# BaaS

The Second State Blockchain as a Service enables users to start a multiple node blockchain with the complete Second State software, including the [Second State Virtual Machine](https://github.com/second-state/lityvm) and [smart contract search engine](https://github.com/second-state/smart-contract-search-engine), with just one click of the mouse. Once it starts, you can [configure BUIDL](../buidl-developer-tool/working-with-baas.md) to use the newly created blockchain immediately!
