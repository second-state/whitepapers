# What is Second State

Second State  builds WebAssembly execution engines, frameworks, and developer toolchain for the cloud. The Second State Virtual Machine \(SSVM\) is a WebAssembly runtime optimized for server-side applications. It provides a managed alternative to unsafe code on the server side, such as native code for high performance, AI, or big data operations, or user submitted code for serverless or SaaS services.
