# What is Second State

Second State builds the next generation open source “operating system” for the cloud and the decentralized web. The Second State Virtual Machine \(SSVM\) is a WebAssembly runtime optimized for server-side applications. It works seamlessly with existing application frameworks, such as Node.js, but provides a secure and lightweight runtime at native performance. It is a managed alternative to native code, and is ideal for building AI and big data microservices. [Check out why](server-side-webassembly/the-case-for-webassembly-on-the-server-side/) you want to use WebAssembly on the server-side.

{% hint style="info" %}
Node.js and Rust developers [get started here](server-side-webassembly/webassembly-on-the-server-side/)! Create high performance Rust + JavaScript hybrid apps in Node.js.
{% endhint %}

The SSVM also powers decentralized applications as the execution engine for leading public blockchains, such as [Ethereum 2.0](https://blog.secondstate.io/post/20191022-soll-compiler-project/), [Ethereum Classic](https://blog.secondstate.io/post/20190901-etc-partners-with-secondstate/), [Polkadot / Web3](https://blog.secondstate.io/post/20200302-polkadot-en/), [Oasis](https://www.coindesk.com/a16z-leads-45-million-raise-for-blockchain-startup-oasis-labs), and [CyberMiles](https://docs.secondstate.io/buidl-developer-tool/getting-started/develop-for-cybermiles).

The [Second State BUIDL IDE](https://www.secondstate.io/buidl/) brings the cloud experience to decentralized apps \(DApps\) developers. It is an entirely browser-based IDE that enables you to

* Write, compile, and deploy smart contracts \(Solidity & Lity\)
* Develop rule-based smart contracts using the Lity rules engine
* Develop & run JavaScript DApps based on smart contracts
* Access web3 & smart contract search engine JS libraries
* Allow other people to run your H5 JavaScript DApp
* Interact with your own Second State blockchain

{% hint style="info" %}
[Create and publish](buidl-developer-tool/getting-started/) a blockchain-based web application \(known as Decentralized Apps or Dapps\) in 5 minutes.
{% endhint %}

Second State is a Venture Capital backed startup with offices in USA, Taiwan, China, and Australia.
