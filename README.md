# What is Second State

Second State builds the next generation open source “operating system” for the cloud and the decentralized web. The Second State Virtual Machine \(SSVM\) is a WebAssembly runtime optimized for server-side applications. It works seamlessly with existing application frameworks, such as Node.js, but provides a secure and lightweight runtime at native performance. It is a managed alternative to native code, and is ideal for building AI and big data microservices.

The SSVM also powers decentralized applications as the execution engine for leading public blockchains, such as Ethereum 2.0, Ethereum Classic, Polkadot / Web3, Oasis, and CyberMiles.

The Second State BUIDL IDE brings the cloud experience to decentralized apps \(DApps\) developers. It is an entirely browser-based IDE that enables you to

* Write, compile, and deploy smart contracts \(Solidity & Lity\)
* Develop rule-based smart contracts using the Lity rules engine
* Develop & run JavaScript DApps based on smart contracts
* Access web3 & smart contract search engine JS libraries
* Allow other people to run your H5 JavaScript DApp
* Interact with your own Second State blockchain
