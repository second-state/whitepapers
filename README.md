# What is Second State

The Second State Virtual Machine \(SSVM\) and compiler toolchain \(SOLL\) power decentralized applications as the execution engine for leading public blockchains, such as [Ethereum 2.0](https://blog.secondstate.io/post/20191022-soll-compiler-project/), [Ethereum Classic](https://blog.secondstate.io/post/20190901-etc-partners-with-secondstate/), [Polkadot / Web3](https://blog.secondstate.io/post/20200302-polkadot-en/), [Oasis](https://www.coindesk.com/a16z-leads-45-million-raise-for-blockchain-startup-oasis-labs), and [CyberMiles](https://docs.secondstate.io/buidl-developer-tool/getting-started/develop-for-cybermiles).

The [Second State BUIDL IDE](https://www.secondstate.io/buidl/) brings the cloud experience to decentralized apps \(DApps\) developers. It is an entirely browser-based IDE that enables you to

* Write, compile, and deploy smart contracts \(Solidity & Lity\)
* Develop rule-based smart contracts using the Lity rules engine
* Develop & run JavaScript DApps based on smart contracts
* Access web3 & smart contract search engine JS libraries
* Allow other people to run your H5 JavaScript DApp
* Interact with your own Second State blockchain
