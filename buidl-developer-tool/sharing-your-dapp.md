# Sharing your DApp

With the DApp now developed and smart contract deployed on chain, it is easy to share your DApp with family, friends, and colleagues. Just click on the **Export** button, it will download and save an HTML file onto your local computer hard drive. You can put the HTML file on any web host and make it accessible to the world. There are many free services to host your HTML files for the world. Here are some examples.

* [Github pages](https://pages.github.com)
* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
* [Drive to web](https://drv.tw) for Google Drive

When users comes to the web page to interact with your DApp, they will see a small gadget at the bottom of the page that allows the user to select his or her blockchain address. Note that all those addresses are automatically generated and the selected address serves as the userâ€™s on chain ID.
