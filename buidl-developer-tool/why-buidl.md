# Why BUIDL

[BUIDL](https://buidl.secondstate.io/) is a browser-based IDE that enables developers to create and deploy Decentralized Applications \(DApps\) on blockchains with ease. For the impatient, watch the [Getting started](getting-started.md) video below.

## Before BUIDL

Before BUIDL came along, developers would have to endure many steps in order to deploy a DApp on a public blockchain. The old way was time consuming, taking between **4 to 8 hours** to complete the entire setup. The following steps are an example of what developers **used to do in the past**.

* Install the [Chrome browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
* Install [metamask Chrome extension](https://metamask.io/) 
* Create and manage accounts in metamask 
* Beg for tokens to add to accounts 
* Install compiler and deployment tools 
  * [Solc](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.3/installing-solidity.html), [web3](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.1/getting-started.html#adding-web3), [node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [GETH](https://geth.ethereum.org/), or [Parity](https://www.parity.io/ethereum/) 
  * [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/) 
  * or use [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) 
* Write, compile, debug, and deploy smart contracts 
* Test and debug on Ethereum networks 
  * Response time is in minutes or even hours
* Write DApp 
  * HTML 
  * CSS 
  * JavaScript 
  * web3 
* Setup a personal web server 
* Deploy the DApp to the web server 
* Test and debug 
  * Response time is in minutes

## After BUIDL

Now with BUIDL, you can write and deploy your DApp in just minutes.
