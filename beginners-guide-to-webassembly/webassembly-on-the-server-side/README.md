# WebAssembly on the server-side

There are great use cases for [WebAssembly on the server-side](https://medium.com/wasm/webassembly-on-the-server-side-c584f874b4a3), especially for AI, blockchain, and big data applications. In this tutorial, I will show you how to incorporate WebAssembly functions, written in Rust, into Node.js applications on the server. We can therefore provide WebAssembly functions as a microservice \(FaaS\).

In this tutorial, we use the Second State Virtual Machine \(SSVM\) , an open source WebAssembly runtime optimized for server-side applications, together with Node.js. The SSVM provides not only a WebAssembly runtime in Node.js, but also a compiler toolchain for Rust and JavaScript.

> While Node.js comes with a default WebAssmebly runtime inside its V8 JavaScript engine, V8 is not designed to handle the performance and complex integration requirements of server-side applications. Compared with V8, the server-optimized SSVM is more performant, integrates better with JavaScript, provides access to external enterprise resources, and supports finely grained metering.

The demo application is structured as follows.

* The host application is a Node.js web application written in JavaScript. It makes WebAssembly function calls.
* The WebAssembly bytecode program is written in Rust. It runs inside the SSVM, and is called from the Node.js web application.

If you just want to try it out and do not wish to setup dev tools on your own machine, you can [fork this repository](https://github.com/second-state/ssvm-nodejs-starter) and have GitHub [build and test](https://github.com/second-state/ssvm-nodejs-starter/actions) your code for you! See instructions here.

#### **Setup**

The `ssvmup` npm module installs the Second State Virtual Machine \(SSVM\) into Node.js as a native `addon`, and provides the necessary compiler tools. Follow the steps below to install Rust and the `ssvmup` tool.

```text
# Prerequisite
$ apt-get update
$ apt install -y build-essential curl wget git vim libboost-all-dev

# Install rust
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
$ source $HOME/.cargo/env

# Install nvm
$ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.3/install.sh | bash
# Follow the on-screen instructions to logout and then log in

# Install node
$ nvm install v10.19.0
$ nvm use v10.19.0

# Install ssvmup toolchain
$ npm install -g ssvmup # Append --unsafe-perm if permission denied

# Install the nodejs addon for SSVM
$ npm install ssvm
```

#### **WebAssembly program in Rust**

In this example, our Rust program appends the input string after “hello”. Let’s create a new `cargo` project. Since this program is intended to be called from a host application, not to run as a stand-alone executable, we will create a `hello` project.

```text
$ cargo new --lib hello
$ cd hello
```

Edit the `Cargo.toml` file to add a `[lib]` section. It tells the compiler where to find the source code for the library and how to generate the bytecode output. We also need to add a dependency of `wasm-bindgen` here. It is the utility `ssvmup` uses to generate the JavaScript binding for the Rust WebAssembly program.

```text
[lib]
name = "hello_lib"
path = "src/lib.rs"
crate-type =["cdylib"]

[dependencies]
wasm-bindgen = "0.2.59"
```

Below is the content of the Rust program `src/lib.rs`. You can actually define multiple external functions in this library file, and all of them will be available to the host JaveScript app via WebAssembly.

```text
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn say(s: String) -> String {
  let r = String::from("hello ");
  return r + &s;
}
```

Next, you can compile the Rust source code into WebAssembly bytecode and generate the accompanying JavaScript module for the Node.js host environment.

```text
$ ssvmup build
```

The result are files in the `pkg/` directory. the `.wasm` file is the WebAssembly bytecode program, and the `.js` files are for the JavaScript module.

#### **The Node.js host application**

Next, let’s create a `node` folder for the Node.js web application. Copy over the generated JavaScript module files.

```text
$ mkdir node
$ cp pkg/hello_lib_bg.wasm node/
$ cp pkg/hello_lib.js node/
```

With the generated `hello_lib.js` module, it is very easy to write JavaScript to call WebAssembly functions. Below is the node application `app.js`. It simply imports the `say()` function from the generated module. The node application takes the `name` parameter from incoming an HTTP GET request, and responds with “hello `name`”.

```text
const { say } = require('./hello_lib.js');

const http = require('http');
const url = require('url');
const hostname = '127.0.0.1';
const port = 8080;

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  const queryObject = url.parse(req.url,true).query;
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  res.end(say(queryObject['name']));
});

server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
});
```

Start the Node.js application server as follows.

```text
$ node app.js
Server running at http://127.0.0.1:8080/
```

Then, you can test it.

```text
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/?name=Wasm
hello Wasm
```

#### **What’s next?**

Now we have seen a very simple example to call a Rust function from JavaScript in a Node.js application. In the next several tutorials, we will look into more complex examples of Rust JavaScript interaction using the SSVM. Let's start with [a review of all input output data types](../rust-javascript-data-exchange.md) supported in the SSVM Rust JavaScript bridge.
