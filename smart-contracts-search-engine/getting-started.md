# Getting started

## Overview

The following image illustrates how the smart contract search engine integrates with a) a blockchain, b) a decentralized application (DApp) and any potential c) third-party application and service.

The smart contract search engine can:
 * index any Ethereum compatible blockchain
 * index any number of smart contracts
 * index any number of blocks
 * be called via Curl
 * be queried via client side Javascript
 * be queried via server side NodeJS
 
## Installation

You can quickly install and use your very own smart contract search engine via [a Docker instance](https://github.com/second-state/whitepapers/blob/master/smart-contracts-search-engine/start-a-search-engine-docker.md). Alternatively, you can install and configure the smart contract search engine for use on [your own Ubuntu Server instance](https://github.com/second-state/whitepapers/blob/master/smart-contracts-search-engine/start-a-search-engine.md).

## Usage

### Configuring the smart contract search engine

All of the configuration for the harvesting is stored in [a single, config.ini, Python configuration file](https://github.com/second-state/smart-contract-search-engine/blob/master/python/config.ini). The explaination for each of the configuration settings i.e. rpc endpoint, index names etc. can be found [here](https://github.com/second-state/whitepapers/blob/master/smart-contracts-search-engine/start-a-search-engine.md#configuring-the-python-harvester-a-single-configini-file).

### Harvesting smart contract data (writing blockchain data to the indices)

The core of the smart contract search engine is [a single, harvest.py, Python file](https://github.com/second-state/smart-contract-search-engine/blob/master/python/harvest.py). All of the harvesting functionality resides in the harvest.py file.

#### Recommended usage - running the harvest.py file once at startup

The harvest.py file is designed to manage all of the tasks associated with harvesting. However, due to the vast differences in blockchains (block intervals, number of blocks, number of ABIs, number of contracts etc.) the harvest.py is designed so that each of the separate tasks can be individually called, using the `-m` mode flag.


#### Using the harvest.py file as a library (useful for testing in certain circumstances)
Whilst technically not the recommended usage, the harvest.py file can also be utilized as a library in the following way. Firstly by starting a Python terminal.

```bash
# Bash syntax
cd /home/smart-contract-search-engine/python
python3.6
```
Then by importing the Harvest code

```python
# Python syntax
from harvest import Harvest
```
Then, the following code will automatically read all of the required configuration from the config.ini file (as the Harvest() object is instantiated as the variable `harvester`).

```python
harvester = Harvest()
```
The above code will allow any of the Harvest functions to be called individually. For example.

```python
_addressHash = "0x123...567"
harvester.getDataUsingAddressHash(_addressHash)
```

 
### Consuming smart contract data (reading blockchain data from the indices)

 * can be queried via client-side JS or server-side NodeJS
